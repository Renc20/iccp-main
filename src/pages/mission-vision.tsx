              <p>
                The International Christian Coalition of Pastors (ICCP) is a
                non-denominational, international group of Christian pastors and
                leaders committed to uniting believers around the world to serve
                God and share the gospel. We strive to empower each other to be
                agents of transformation and reconciliation in our communities,
                to be a light and a witness of Godâ€™s love and grace, and to be a
                unified voice in speaking out against injustice, poverty, and
                oppression. We recognize and celebrate the strength of our
                differences, providing our members with the knowledge and
                resources they need to be effective in their mission and to
                foster a spirit of unity among us. Together, we are determined
                to create a better world, rooted in the love of God.
